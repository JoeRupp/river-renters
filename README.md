# River Renters üèû

## Overview:

River Renters is a white water rafting rental site. This application is a solo project completed during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design that was completed over the duration of 5 days. The main goal of this project was to build a full React application with a front end and back end using various tools like Express, React Router, and Cypress.

The world of white water rafting is difficult to get into. Gear is expensive, going with a company on a guided trip is expensive, and permits for a river trip take a tremendous amount of luck. You either need to know someone or have time/money. River Renters seeks to solve some these problems by providing folks a way to rent fully rigged (or partially rigged) rafts - helping to lower the barrier of entry so more people can get out there.

## Set Up:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- `cd` into the application.
- Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to run the application in your browser.
  - If you need to stop running the application, run `control + C`.

## Goals:

- Implement React Router to handle multiple views and navigation.
- Make the application design responsive to various screen sizes.
- Build a back end API with Express and display the data from it.
- Do end-to-end testing using Cypress.

## Technologies:

- React
- Javascript
- CSS
- Cypress
- React Router
- Express
- Restful APIs
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop

## Future Additions:

- Create a more robust home page with Parallax effects.
- Create a "Build Your Own Rig" Page, allowing the user to build a customized raft to rent from a list of supplies (boat, frame, oars, etc).
- Create a more robust renting form to simulate what it would be like for a user to actually rent a full white water raft.
